# UFO Sightings 

UFO Sighting Data can be filtered through the use of Javascript, Bootstrap, and HTML/CSS.

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to use Javascript and a HTML page to support Dana's article on UFO Sightings in McMinniville, Oregon. Though this analysis, Javascript was used to display the data on UFO sightings into a table with filters available to narrow down searches. HTML was used to house imporatnt information on the topic Dana is focusing on. A HTML page was used to house her article, table of data, and filtes to fine tune results. In a previous version of the HTML page, you were able to filter the data by date but though this addtional analysis piece, the user is not able to filter for muluitp,e criteria at the same time. 

## Results
This analysis and HTML page is intended to invite a user to interact with the page and fine tune filters as they investigate UFO sightings. This home page is intended to start that interaction by telling the user the page is open and is meant for the user to search for results themselves.

The HTMl page is mean to provide a ease in data filtering by allowing the user to filter and interact with the data without needing to download a copy of the file. These filters include the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the encounter.
### Navigating HTML: 
The user will beed to click on the input boxes in order to be able to navigate the page's functionality. The filtering seach is based in out-put boxes instead of drop down options to allow for the User to place in these key words to the city or state they want to look at.If the user inputs an incorrect fitler or a variable that doesn't exist in the data, they will be be shows a empty table. To return to the original dataset without filters being used click on the top left where it says UFO Sightings and the HTML will be re-directed.

## Summary
One drawback with this filter feature is the case sentiviry in the filter boxes. In code, Javascript is case sensitive and this website is the same in the sense that if the letter is a captial letter it will not return a result. This could cause some errors for the user as captilization is often used for City and State names, which may cause the user confusion as the table will not return a value. 

One recommendation is to add a filter for duration. UFO sightings is a popular topic amoungst anthropologist and UFO enthusiatis. By allowing the table to be filtered by duration, you would allow the user to capture certain groups of time. One example is a filter for encounters of over 15mins or more as these encounters will have the most amount of detail given their time duration. 

Recommendation two would be to filter the Shape in a different way. This could be in the form of a drop down tab, which would allow the user to futhur narrrow down their search results by allowing them to see thse options in a quick way as there are several options shown for Shape.
